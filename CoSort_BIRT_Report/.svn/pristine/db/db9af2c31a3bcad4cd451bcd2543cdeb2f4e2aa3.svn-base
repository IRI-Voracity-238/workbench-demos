Steps for creating an ODA connection from SortCL to BIRT:

1.  Create your SortCL script in the IRI Workbench
    The first Outfile section must be /OUTFILE=stdout and must include a /FIELD declarations for
    every column that will be used in the report (as well as supporting fields such as /SUM that 
    will populate the field values).

2.  Switch to the Report Design perspective
    Click Window, Open Perspective, Report Design. If BIRT is not installed, see step one in the
    Notes.txt file in this project folder.

3.  Create a New Report
    Right click on the folder you are working with in the Navigator section. Move it to the SAME
    folder with your SortCL script. Follow the wizard instructions to create your report design.

4.  Specify the IRI Data Source
    In the Data Explorer tab, right click on Data Sources and select New Data Source. Select the
    IRI Data Source from the available list and click Next. Under Select folder, enter or browse 
    to specify the full path name to the folder with the report and SortCL script. Click Finish.

5.  Specify the Data Set
    Right click on Data Sets, and select New Data Set. Select the Data Source specified above and
    click Next. At the top, select the script you wish to use for your report from that drop down
    box. The /OUTFILE fields declared in the SortCL script will appear on the left. Highlight the
    fields and click the middle yellow arrow to arrange them in the report. Click Finish.

6.  Customize and Create the Report
    On the next page, you can make changes to your data source and data set. Also add, remove and 
    rearrange selected columns, add computed columns, and preview the raw data.
