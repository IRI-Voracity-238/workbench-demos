## Database Schema for Demo Projects
The file *SCOTT-DDL.sql* contains the SQL necessary to create most of the empty tables used in the demo 
projects. There are usually SQL files in each project, this is just a convenient way to create most of 
the tables at one time. Useful when setting up a demo environment for the first time.

If you have no existing tables, then do not execute the relevant DROP statements in the top of the file.
